With VS Code Desktop Support, you can keep your local IDE configurations<sup>1</sup> **and** benefit from Gitpod's high-spec servers & automated prebuilds. As you would expect, your code executes in an ephemeral Gitpod workspace which keeps each of your projects nicely isolated from one another.

To get started:

1. Start a new Gitpod workspace ([learn how](/docs/getting-started) in the docs).
1. Open the command palette (â‡§âŒ˜P or Ctrl+Shift+P)
1. Type "Open in VS Code" and hit Enter.

This command will open your local VS Code, connect to the Gitpod workspace and let you develop, test & debug your application as if the code was running locally.

VS Code desktop support installs, manages and runs the [Local Companion](/docs/ides-and-editors/local-companion) app under-the-hood so you don't have to. However, if you're currently using the local companion, you can can continue to use it independently.

<br />
<sup>1</sup> Yes this also means you get to keep your keyboard shortcuts just the way you prefer them. You know, Ctrl/Cmd + W to close an editor tab ðŸ˜‰.

## Managing extensions

VS Code runs extensions in one of two places: locally on the UI / client side, or remotely on your Gitpod workspace.

For further details, please refer to the official VS Code docs on how to [manage extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_managing-extensions).

## Installing custom fonts

The process of installing fonts matches how you typically install custom fonts locally:

1. Download the desired font to your local machine and install it locally on your operating system.
1. Open the editor's user settings (e.g. _File_ > _Preferences_ > _Settings_ > _User_)
1. Configure your font with the `editor.fontFamily` setting:
   ```json
   {
     "editor.fontFamily": "Your custom font name"
   }
   ```

## Settings Sync

By default, your local VS Code installation is _most likely_ equipped with a pre-configured setup to sync all of your IDE-related settings via a GitHub or a Microsoft account. This means that your preferences are synced to Microsoft's servers and that means Gitpod has no access to them.

You can change this fact and sync all of your preferences to Gitpod instead. You will not lose any data by doing this, but if you still want to sync your settings across machines we recommend you to do the same on all of them as well.

1. Make sure the Gitpod extension is installed and enabled.
2. Hit <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the Command Pallete and run `Gitpod: Turn on Settings Sync`.
3. Complete the login process by clicking on the `Accounts` menu and selecting `Sign in to Settings Sync`. This will open Gitpod where you can just follow the steps to allow Settings sync from your local VS Code.
4. Yay; it's done ðŸŽ‰! Extensions and other preferences should start syncing right away. For troubleshooting you can take a look at `OUTPUT` > `Log (Settings Sync)`.

If you want to read more about Settings Sync and how it works please refer to [VS Code's Settings Sync documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync).
